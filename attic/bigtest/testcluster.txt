client nodes send requests to several request servers.
The request result is sent to HTHosts and stored there.
HtHosts promote the changes to HTlisteners which build a mirror.
Binary receiver receives random byte arrays with a checksum and promotes them back to client nodes
Cyclically all HTHosts deliver their complete content and it is compared with the clients mirror.
